# RH - Rust Healthcare Toolkit

**RH** is a modern, high-performance toolkit for working with HL7Â® FHIRÂ®, purpose-built in **Rust**. It provides ergonomic, developer-friendly APIs that are modular, easy to understand, and highly extendable. It also ships with a powerful **command-line interface (CLI)** designed with the **Unix philosophy** in mind: superior UX, small, composable, and ideal for scripting and automation.

Cross-platform and lightning-fast, and running nativelly cross platform, RH eliminates the overhead of heavy virtual machines like the JVM or .NET. RH can even be compiled to **WebAssembly** for seamless integration into web applications and embedded environments.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and build the entire workspace
git clone <repo-url>
cd research
cargo build
```


## Workspace Structure

```

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ rh-cli/                # Unified cross-platform CLI for FHIR
â”œâ”€â”€ setup.sh                # Development setup script
â””â”€â”€ build.sh                # Build script for CI/CD
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70 or later
- Cargo (comes with Rust)

### Development Setup

Run the setup script to configure your development environment:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

### Building

Build all packages in the workspace:

```bash
cargo build
```

Build a specific package:

```bash
cargo build -p <package-name>
```

### Testing

Run all tests:

```bash
cargo test
```

Run tests for a specific package:

```bash
cargo test -p <package-name>
```

NOTE: You can also use `just`
```bash
just --help
```

### Development Commands

All functionality is available through the unified `rh` CLI.

**For complete CLI documentation and examples, see the [RH CLI documentation](apps/rh-cli/README.md)**

**Unified CLI (recommended):**
```bash
# Code generation
cargo run -p rh -- codegen --help

# FHIRPath operations
cargo run -p rh -- fhirpath --help

# ValueSet Compose Language (VCL) operations
cargo run -p rh -- vcl --help
```

Check code formatting:

```bash
cargo fmt --check
```

Apply formatting:

```bash
cargo fmt
```

Run clippy lints:

```bash
cargo clippy
```

Run clippy with all features:

```bash
cargo clippy --all-features
```

Run tests:

```bash
cargo tes
```

## Dependency Management

### Workspace Dependencies

Add common dependencies to the root `Cargo.toml`, e.g.:

```toml
[workspace.dependencies]
serde = "1.0"
tokio = "1.0"
anyhow = "1.0"
```

Then reference them in individual crates, e.g.:

```toml
[dependencies]
serde = { workspace = true }
tokio = { workspace = true }
```

### Crate-specific Dependencies

Add directly to the crate's `Cargo.toml`, e.g.:

```toml
[dependencies]
regex = "1.0"
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Setup**: Run `./setup.sh` once to configure your environment
2. **Development**: Work in individual crates with full workspace support
3. **Testing**: `cargo test` runs all tests across the workspace
4. **Building**: `cargo build` builds everything with optimized dependencies
5. **Linting**: `cargo clippy` checks all code for best practices

## Release Management

The workspace supports coordinated releases of all crates or individual crate releases as needed. Use semantic versioning and update `Cargo.toml` files accordingly.
