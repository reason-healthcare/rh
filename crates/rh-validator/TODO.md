# RH Validator Implementation Roadmap

**Status:** Planning → Implementation  
**Design Document:** [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md)  
**Start Date:** October 23, 2025

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation of the RH FHIR validator as described in DESIGN.md. The implementation will replace existing code with a clean, performance-focused architecture.

---

## Phase 0: Cleanup & Foundation

**Goal:** Remove existing code and establish clean foundation  
**Duration:** 1-2 days  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Tasks

- [x] **Remove existing validation code**
  - [x] Delete current `src/` implementation
  - [x] Keep only `Cargo.toml`, `README.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `TODO.md`
  - [x] Update `Cargo.toml` dependencies for new design
  - [x] Ensure workspace still compiles (crate can be empty for now)

- [x] **Define core types**
  - [x] Create `src/types.rs` with core validation types:
    - [x] `ValidationResult`
    - [x] `ValidationIssue`
    - [x] `Severity` enum (with custom ordering: Error > Warning > Information)
    - [x] `IssueCode` enum
    - [x] `Invariant` struct (will be shared with codegen)
    - [x] `ValidatorError` enum
  - [x] Add comprehensive doc comments
  - [x] Add unit tests for type constructors and utilities (8 tests)
  - [x] Add benchmark stubs in `benches/validation.rs`

- [x] **Update dependencies**
  - [x] Removed unnecessary dependencies (dirs, glob, tokio, tracing, rh-loader, rh-codegen)
  - [x] Added criterion for benchmarking
  - [x] Kept minimal deps: serde, serde_json, anyhow, thiserror, rh-foundation

### Success Criteria
- [x] Empty crate compiles successfully
- [x] Core types defined with full documentation
- [x] All tests pass: `cargo test -p rh-validator` (8/8 tests passing)
- [x] No clippy warnings: `cargo clippy -p rh-validator`

**Completion Date:** [Current Session]

## Known Issues & Decisions

### Current Limitations
- Terminology validation deferred to Phase 7
- Reference validation deferred to Phase 7
- Extension validation is basic (no StructureDefinition loading)
- Bundle transaction semantics not validated

### Design Decisions
- **No validation methods on generated types**: See DESIGN.md rationale
- **External validator pattern**: Better performance and flexibility
- **Rayon for parallelism**: Work-stealing is ideal for varying resource complexity
- **Separate invariant extraction**: Codegen handles it, validator consumes it

### Open Questions
- [ ] Should we support FHIR versions other than R4? (STU3, R5)
- [ ] How to handle custom terminology servers?
- [ ] Should we validate narrative (HTML) for security issues?
- [ ] Support for GraphQL validation?

## Contributing

When implementing:
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/validator-phase-N`
2. Update this TODO with progress (check boxes)
3. Write tests first (TDD approach)
4. Ensure all tests pass: `cargo test -p rh-validator`
5. Run clippy: `cargo clippy -p rh-validator -- -D warnings`
6. Update documentation
7. Commit with conventional format: `feat(validator): <description>`
8. Create PR with reference to this TODO

---

## Notes

- This replaces ALL existing code in `rh-validator` - we start fresh
- Follow the design in DESIGN.md strictly
- Each phase should be fully tested before moving to next
- Performance benchmarks should be run at each phase
- Document any deviations from the design with rationale
