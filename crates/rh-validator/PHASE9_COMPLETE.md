## Phase 9 Completion (2025-10-24)

Phase 9: Cardinality Validation is now **COMPLETE** âœ…

### What was delivered:
- Foundation layer: ElementCardinality struct with 5 helper methods
- Code generation: CardinalityGenerator extracts and generates CARDINALITIES constants
- Validator: validate_cardinality() method checks min/max constraints
- Configuration: skip_cardinality option added
- Tests: 5 comprehensive cardinality tests (all passing)
- Example: cardinality_validation.rs demonstrating all features
- Quality: All checks passing (fmt, clippy, tests, audit)

### Files changed:
- crates/rh-foundation/src/validation.rs - Added ElementCardinality
- crates/rh-foundation/src/lib.rs - Exported ElementCardinality
- crates/rh-hl7_fhir_r4_core/src/validation.rs - Extended ValidatableResource trait
- crates/rh-codegen/src/generators/cardinality_generator.rs - NEW (138 lines)
- crates/rh-codegen/src/generators/file_generator.rs - Integrated cardinality generation
- crates/rh-codegen/src/generators/validation_trait_generator.rs - Updated trait impl
- crates/rh-validator/src/validator.rs - Added validate_cardinality() method
- crates/rh-validator/tests/cardinality_validation_test.rs - NEW (120 lines, 5 tests)
- crates/rh-validator/examples/cardinality_validation.rs - NEW (110 lines)
- crates/rh-hl7_fhir_r4_core/src/resources/patient.rs - Manual test with CARDINALITIES
- crates/rh-hl7_fhir_r4_core/tests/cardinality_test.rs - Integration test

### Deferred items:
- Full resource regeneration (tested with Patient only)  
- CLI --skip-cardinality flag
- Nested element cardinality (BackboneElement)
- Profile-specific cardinality (reserved for profile validation phase)
- Dedicated cardinality benchmarks

**Next phase:** Phase 10 (to be determined)
